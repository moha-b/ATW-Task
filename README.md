# Task

this task was implemented first with `cubit` in this [branch](https://github.com/moha-b/ATW-Task/tree/cubit) because it's too simple to implement with `bloc` but I make it anyway in the main branch and there is another approach smiler to `cubit` implementation in this [branch](https://github.com/moha-b/ATW-Task/tree/bloc)
